In this project I have followed MVVM clean architecture pattern. Where I have a data source,
repository, use case, view model and view.

-Use Hilt for dependency injection.

-Use Adapter delegate pattern for displaying Multiple view types in recycler view using
sockeqwe/AdapterDelegates (https://github.com/sockeqwe/AdapterDelegates)
